GOLD RUSH
===========
The objective of Gold Rush is to transport the gold on the island on the right
to the island on the left while avoiding the mines. Increasing the difficulty increases
the number of mines.

The boat can only carry 1000 units of gold at a time,
and crashing with any gold on board returns the gold to the island.
